# MotherWise: AI-Powered Pregnancy Guide and Support for Expectant Mothers


## Introduction

**MotherWise** is an open-source, AI-powered assistant created to support expectant mothers throughout their pregnancy journey.

## Problem Statement

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) remains a severe challenge in many regions of India and Africa, particularly in rural and underserved areas. In these regions, pregnancy-related complications often go untreated due to a lack of knowledge, timely healthcare access, and social stigmas. Many women are unaware of the risks and appropriate care required during pregnancy, leading to preventable complications and fatalities. By bridging gaps in knowledge and resources, MotherWise empowers expectant mothers with the information they need to navigate their pregnancy with confidence and support.
